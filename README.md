for run in local you need to use docker in your system
but first clone the project
```
git@github.com:sina47822/company-develope-wordpress-theme.git
```
then
```
docker compose up --build
```
you need to use these plugins below in wordpress
--> elementor
--> 7 form

but through the project it used acf pro and cmb2

for all things work better you need to import acf from acf-import folder
